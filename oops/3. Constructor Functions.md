# [**Constructor Functions**]()

| [_KEYWORDS / QUESTIONS_]()                                       |

### [_NOTES_]()

- Constructor function is another way of creating an object.
- Function name will be in Pascal naming convention. This resembled Class like syntax.
- Instead of return an object compare to Factory functions, `this` keyword will be used to refer to the object.
- So using `this`, I can set properties and methods to an object.

```js
function CreateCircle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
  this.draw = function () {
    console.log(`draw(): ${radius}`);
  };
}
```

- While creating an object, we should use `new` keyword.
- When we use `new` keyword to create an object.

  - Create an empty `{}` object.
  - Set `this` to point to the object.

    _Note: By default `this` points to the global object. In browser, it'll be Window object. In Node.JS, it'll be Global object._

  - `this` points to the local object. In this case, `CreateCircle` object and return it. Unlike Factory function, we are not returing an object. `new` keyword will take care of it using `this` keyword.

- When we don't use `new` keyword to create an object.
  - No empty `{}` object will be created.
  - `this` points to the global object.
  - Both `radius` and `draw()` will be available globally. [X]
  - Avoid global declaration as much as possible.

```js
const circle1 = new CreateCircle(1);
circle1.draw();

const circle2 = new CreateCircle(2);
circle2.draw();
```

- We can also define an object using Constructor functions.

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No special about Factory or Constructor functions.                                      |
| Factory function will return an object.                                                 |
| Constructor function will use `new` and `this` keywords to create an object.            |
| `new` will create entirly new object in memory and points `this` to the created object. |
