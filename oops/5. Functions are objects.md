### [_NOTES_]()

- Every object in JS has a constructor property and that references the function that was used to create that object.
- As we saw `circle.constructor` returns `f Function()`. This mease that `Circle` object is created by `Function()` object.
- When we use `function Circle() { ... }` syntax to create a function, internally JS engine will use `f Function() {[native code]}` builtin constructor to create this object.

**Constructor function**

```js
function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
  ...
}

const circle = new Circle(1);

circle.constructor;
// f Function()
```

- Internally, JS engine create `Function()` object as follows

```js
const Circle = new Function("radius", `this.radius = radius; ...`);

const circle = new Circle(1);

circle.constructor;
// f Function()
```
