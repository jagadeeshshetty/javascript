### _NOTES_

- Basic of all data structures.
- Arrays are used to store data in a sequential manner.
- Each array has a fixed number of cells decided on its creation, and each cell has a corresponding numeric index used to select its data.
- Whenever youâ€™d like to use the array, all you need are the desired indices, and you can access any of the data within.
